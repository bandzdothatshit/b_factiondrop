# b_factiondrop
Here is a very simple faction drop script for serious roleplay servers. This is an item that you add to ox_inventory. You can name the item whatever you want. Currently, there is no image for it, but you can definitely find one on Google!

## Item
Item to add to `ox_inventory/data/items.lua`
```
	['ftier1'] = {
		label = 'Faction Drop (1)',
		weight = 1500,
		stack = false,
	},
```
